# lc 45 Jump Game II
# https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/

# Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

# why greedy: at every step, it makes a locally optimal choice â€” that is, it tries to extend the farthest possible range (to_max) that can be reached at that point in time.
def jump(nums):
    n = len(nums)

    for i in range(n - 1):

        if i == current:
            jumps += 1
            current = to_max
